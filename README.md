# AirBnB clone - The console

The AirBnB clone project starts now until… the end of the first year. The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

You won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:

=> A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)

=> A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic

=> A database or files that store data (data = objects)

=> An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

[Creating an Airbnb clone with a console interface]() involves building a simplified version of the Airbnb platform that can be interacted with using commands in a command-line interface (CLI). The console allows users to perform various actions such as creating and managing listings, booking properties, and handling user accounts.

Here's a basic outline of how you can approach building an Airbnb clone with a console interface:

1. [Data Model:]()
Define the data model for your application, including classes for User, Property, and Booking. These classes will represent the main entities in your Airbnb clone.

2. [Console Interface:]()
Implement the console interface using Python's built-in input() function or a library like argparse to parse commands and arguments. Users will interact with the application by typing commands and providing necessary information in the console.

3. [CRUD Operations:]()
Implement the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each entity. Users should be able to create new users and properties, read information about users and properties, update property details, and delete properties.

4. [Listing Properties:]()
Allow users to list available properties, either by displaying all properties or by applying filters (e.g., location, price, availability) to the search results.

5. [Booking Properties:]()
Enable users to book a property for specific dates. Implement checks to ensure that a property is available for the desired dates before confirming the booking.

6. [User Authentication:]()
Implement a basic user authentication system to allow users to log in and log out of the application. This can be as simple as storing user information in memory or using a file-based database like JSON.

7. [Data Persistence:]()
To make your application useful beyond a single session, consider adding data persistence. Use a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) to store user, property, and booking information between sessions.

8. [Error Handling:]()
Implement error handling for common scenarios, such as incorrect commands, invalid input, or unavailable properties.

9. [Testing:]()
Create unit tests to verify that each component of your application is working correctly. Use a testing framework like unittest or pytest.

10. [Documentation:]()
Provide clear and concise documentation for your Airbnb clone, including instructions on how to use the console interface, available commands, and examples.

[Note That:]() Remember that building a full-fledged Airbnb clone involves many complexities and features not covered in this basic outline, such as payment processing, property verification, reviews, and more. However, this outline should give you a starting point to build a simplified version with basic functionalities. As you progress, you can expand and refine your implementation to make it more robust and feature-rich.
