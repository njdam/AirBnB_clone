# AirBnB clone - The console

## 1. Description of the project.

The AirBnB clone project starts now until… the end of the first year. The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the [AirBnB website](https://www.airbnb.com/).

You won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:

=> A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)

=> A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic

=> A database or files that store data (data = objects)

=> An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

[Creating an Airbnb clone with a console interface]() involves building a simplified version of the Airbnb platform that can be interacted with using commands in a command-line interface (CLI). The console allows users to perform various actions such as creating and managing listings, booking properties, and handling user accounts.

Here's a basic outline of how you can approach building an Airbnb clone with a console interface:

1. [Data Model:]()
Define the data model for your application, including classes for User, Property, and Booking. These classes will represent the main entities in your Airbnb clone.

2. [Console Interface:]()
Implement the console interface using Python's built-in input() function or a library like argparse to parse commands and arguments. Users will interact with the application by typing commands and providing necessary information in the console.

3. [CRUD Operations:]()
Implement the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each entity. Users should be able to create new users and properties, read information about users and properties, update property details, and delete properties.

4. [Listing Properties:]()
Allow users to list available properties, either by displaying all properties or by applying filters (e.g., location, price, availability) to the search results.

5. [Booking Properties:]()
Enable users to book a property for specific dates. Implement checks to ensure that a property is available for the desired dates before confirming the booking.

6. [User Authentication:]()
Implement a basic user authentication system to allow users to log in and log out of the application. This can be as simple as storing user information in memory or using a file-based database like JSON.

7. [Data Persistence:]()
To make your application useful beyond a single session, consider adding data persistence. Use a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) to store user, property, and booking information between sessions.

8. [Error Handling:]()
Implement error handling for common scenarios, such as incorrect commands, invalid input, or unavailable properties.

9. [Testing:]()
Create unit tests to verify that each component of your application is working correctly. Use a testing framework like unittest or pytest.

10. [Documentation:]()
Provide clear and concise documentation for your Airbnb clone, including instructions on how to use the console interface, available commands, and examples.

[Note That:]() Remember that building a full-fledged Airbnb clone involves many complexities and features not covered in this basic outline, such as payment processing, property verification, reviews, and more. However, this outline should give you a starting point to build a simplified version with basic functionalities. As you progress, you can expand and refine your implementation to make it more robust and feature-rich.


## 2. Description of the command interpreter.

[A command interpreter](), also known as `a command-line interpreter` or `shell`, is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer's operating system and execute various commands. It allows users to interact with the system by typing in commands, which are then interpreted and executed by the operating system. Command interpreters are commonly found in Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux) and Windows Command Prompt.

[Here's a general overview of how to start and use a command interpreter, along with some examples:]()

I. [Starting the Command Interpreter:]()

1. [Windows Command Prompt:]() You can typically find the Command Prompt by searching for "cmd" in the Start menu or by pressing Win + R, typing "cmd," and hitting Enter.

2. [Unix-like Systems (Linux/macOS):]() You can usually open a terminal emulator by searching for "Terminal" in the applications menu or by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T.


II. [Using the Command Interpreter:]()

1. [Navigate the File System:]()

=> `cd`: Change directory.
=> `ls` (Linux/macOS) or `dir` (Windows): List files and directories in the current directory.

2. [Manipulate Files and Directories:]()

=> `mkdir`: Create a new directory.
=> `touch`: Create an empty file.
=> `cp`: Copy files or directories.
=> `mv`: Move or rename files or directories.
=> `rm`: Remove files or directories.

3. [Text Editing:]()

=> `nano`, `vim`, `emacs`: Text editors available in the command line.

4. [Viewing and Managing Processes:]()

=> `ps`: Display information about currently running processes.
=> `kill`: Terminate a process.

5. [Networking:]()

=> `ping`: Send ICMP echo requests to a host for network testing.
=> `wget` or `curl`: Download files from the internet.

6. [System Information:]()

=> `uname`: Display system information (e.g., kernel version).
=> `df`: Show disk space usage.
=> `free`: Display memory usage.

7. [Package Management (Linux):]()

=> `apt` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `yum` (CentOS): Install, update, and manage software packages.


III. [Examples:]()

[Change directory and list files:]()
```
cd Documents
ls
```

[Create a new directory and a file:]()
```
mkdir NewFolder
touch NewFile.txt
```

[Copy and rename files:]()
```
cp file1.txt file2.txt
mv file2.txt newfile.txt
```

[View process information and terminate a process:]()
```
ps aux | grep firefox
kill <process_id>
```

[Download a file from the internet:]()
`wget https://example.com/file.txt`

[Display system information:]()
```
uname -a
df -h
free -h
```

[Note That:]() Remember that command syntax might vary slightly between different systems, so it's important to consult the documentation or built-in help (`<command> --help` or man `<command>`) for specific details on each command.


## 3. A Command Interpreter for an Airbnb Clone project

For an `Airbnb Clone project`, you might want to consider using a `command-line interface` (CLI) to interact with your application. The CLI could provide functionalities for managing properties, bookings, users, and other aspects of your project.

Here's a description of the CLI along with instructions on how to start and use it, along with some example commands:

[Description of the Command Interpreter:]()
In the context of your Airbnb Clone project, the command-line interpreter (CLI) is a tool that allows you to interact with your application's functionalities through the command line. It provides an efficient way for users (hosts, guests, administrators) to manage properties, make bookings, handle user accounts, and perform other actions related to the Airbnb-like platform you are creating.

I. [How to Start the Command Interpreter:]()
To start the command interpreter for your Airbnb Clone project, you might need to develop a custom CLI using a programming language like Python. Here's a simplified outline of how you could structure your CLI:

1. Create a Python script, e.g., `airbnb_cli.py`, that will serve as the entry point for your CLI.

2. Implement functions or classes within the script to handle various commands and actions related to your Airbnb Clone project.

3. Use libraries like `argparse` or `click` to parse command-line arguments and options.

4. Provide informative help messages to guide users on available commands and their usage.


II. [How to Use the Command Interpreter:]()
Users would start the command interpreter by executing the `airbnb_cli.py` script followed by appropriate commands and options.

[Example structure of CLI commands:]()
```
python airbnb_cli.py <command> [options]
```

I. [Examples of CLI Commands:]()

1. [Creating a New Property Listing:]()
```
python airbnb_cli.py create_property --title "Cozy Studio Apartment" --price 100 --capacity 2
```

2. [Making a Booking:]()
```
python airbnb_cli.py book_property --property_id 123 --start_date "2023-09-01" --end_date "2023-09-07"
```

3. [Displaying Property Information:]()
```
python airbnb_cli.py show_property --property_id 123
```

4. [Managing User Accounts:]()
```
python airbnb_cli.py create_user --username johndoe --email john@example.com --role guest
python airbnb_cli.py deactivate_user --username johndoe
```

5. [Searching for Properties:]()
```
python airbnb_cli.py search_properties --location "New York" --start_date "2023-08-15" --end_date "2023-08-20"
```

6. [Displaying Help:]()
```
python airbnb_cli.py --help
python airbnb_cli.py create_property --help
```

[Note That:]() Remember that the above examples are simplified and illustrative. The actual implementation of your CLI and the available commands will depend on the complexity of your Airbnb Clone project and the features you want to offer. Additionally, make sure to include proper error handling and user-friendly feedback in your CLI to enhance the user experience.
