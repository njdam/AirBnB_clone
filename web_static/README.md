# AirBnB clone - Web static

The term "`AirBnB clone - Web static`" likely refers to a project that involves creating a static version of a website similar to Airbnb. This could be a part of a larger project where you are replicating the user interface and design of the Airbnb website without implementing the backend functionality.

The term "`web static`" indicates that the project focuses on creating static web pages, which means the content and layout are fixed and don't change dynamically based on user interactions or data from a backend server.

Here's what you might typically do as part of an "`AirBnB clone - Web static`" project:

1. [HTML Structure:]() Create the HTML structure for different pages such as the homepage, listings, search results, property details, user profiles, and more.

2. [CSS Styling:]() Apply CSS styles to replicate the visual design of the Airbnb website. This involves setting colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and other styling elements to match the original website.

3. [Images and Media:]() Include images of properties, user avatars, icons, and other media elements that are part of the Airbnb design.

4. [Navigation:]() Implement navigation menus, headers, and footers to provide a consistent layout across different pages.

5. [Responsive Design:]() Ensure that the web pages are responsive, meaning they adapt to different screen sizes and devices, such as mobile phones and tablets.

6. [Static Interaction:]() Implement static interactions such as buttons, links, and hover effects. These interactions won't involve dynamic behavior but rather simulate the visual effects that users would see.

7. [No Backend Functionality:]() Unlike the actual Airbnb website, this static version won't have backend functionality like user authentication, property booking, messaging, or database interactions.

[Note That:]() The purpose of such a project could be to practice web development skills, demonstrate proficiency in HTML and CSS, and showcase your ability to replicate a real-world website's design.
